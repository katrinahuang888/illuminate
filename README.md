# illuminate
Through Wellesley College's CS 320 Tangible User Interfaces, a team and I worked to create a functional lamp that reinvents classroom dynamics.

# problem statement
Collaboration is essential in nearly every environment, industry, or role you find yourself in. Despite how prevalent teamwork is, issues with productivity, creativity, and individual well-being arise. Destructive group behaviors, like unequal contributions from members, lack of focus or organization, and difficulty managing different working styles and/or personalities, can hinder a team’s productivity, impacting student or business projects, a company’s revenue, or members’ relationships with each other. This is especially true for larger companies that rely on cross-functional teams and complex project coordination. 

# target user population
Students: Amplifying visibility to all students, enabling them to participate in conversations without being interrupted or unacknowledged.
Instructors/Discussion Leads: Keep track of the conversation and group dynamics, ensuring that no one is dominating and that every student has the chance to speak.

# goals
To elevate discussions through creative methods of classroom dynamic management.
To encourage more shy/socially anxious individuals to participate during class.
To grow listening skills (minimizing distractions,  verbal/non-verbal communication).

# why a TUI?
Introduces a new method of person-to-person interaction.
Creatively mediates common classroom dynamic issues.
Connects traditional art-making practices with modern. technologies.
Visualizes the emotions of the user in a gentle manner.
Distance sensor (alters brightness) creates further opportunities for user agency.
