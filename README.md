# illuminate
Through Wellesley College's CS 320 Tangible User Interfaces, a team and I worked to create a functional lamp that reinvents classroom dynamics.

# problem statement
Collaboration is essential in nearly every environment, industry, or role you find yourself in. Despite how prevalent teamwork is, issues with productivity, creativity, and individual well-being arise. Destructive group behaviors, like unequal contributions from members, lack of focus or organization, and difficulty managing different working styles and/or personalities, can hinder a team’s productivity, impacting student or business projects, a company’s revenue, or members’ relationships with each other. This is especially true for larger companies that rely on cross-functional teams and complex project coordination. 

# target user population
Students: Amplifying visibility to all students, enabling them to participate in conversations without being interrupted or unacknowledged.
Instructors/Discussion Leads: Keep track of the conversation and group dynamics, ensuring that no one is dominating and that every student has the chance to speak.

# goals
To elevate discussions through creative methods of classroom dynamic management.
To encourage more shy/socially anxious individuals to participate during class.
To grow listening skills (minimizing distractions,  verbal/non-verbal communication).

# why a TUI?
Introduces a new method of person-to-person interaction.
Creatively mediates common classroom dynamic issues.
Connects traditional art-making practices with modern. technologies.
Visualizes the emotions of the user in a gentle manner.
Distance sensor (alters brightness) creates further opportunities for user agency.

# our proposed solution
As seen below, we are proposing a design that is visually aesthetic and impactful. We will solder individual colorful glass or plastic pieces to form an elliptical prism. The shape was chosen for its height and visibility. These bright colors may improve innovation and creativity during design discussions. The inner components include a light and audio that will light up and make a sound when the lamp is pressed on. The glass or plastic pieces will all light up when the lamp is pressed to capture the visual attention of team members while the light audio playing from the lamp will alert them to direct their attention to the individual.

We believe a tangible approach is effective in addressing this problem as these products can function as an extension of the user. Today’s world is becoming increasingly virtual. And, some may have it tiresome or stressful to try and interject in meetings with their own body, such as speaking over others or raising their hands for an extended duration of time. By having a real and concrete object (rather than abstract or virtual) in front of every individual at a meeting, we give each individual equal power to interject themselves into a conversation, boosting their confidence and giving them a sense of value and impact within the group.
